    text: "From the beginning of time I can remember always doodling. Whether it was on a test, homework, on a book I was reading, or at home; I’ve always been a visual artist. As someone who barely creates artanymore, the panidemic has sparked it back into me. Now I’m not goingto say that I go all the way, I draw lines I am not one to color and do shading. I am an outliner but at my core I'm still an artist.",

    text: "I love to travel. I've been to 38 of the 50 states. I believe traveling makes us better people. It's one of the best educational institutes. It opens our minds and hearts to new people and perspectives. I always learn something new and come back home as a better person. Internationally I’ve only been to the caribbean but I'm making plans to visit some of the other continents.",

    title: "Tech Geek",
    text: "I am a millenial. I grew up with technology and it plays a huge role in my life. I wake up to read about the new trends in tech, I watch reviews and I purchase the latest gadgets. Tech opens up opportunities to the masses. The more I use tech tech the more it feels like nothing is really out of reach. Tech is progress.",

    title: "Health",
    text: "During the pandemic I went on a 3 month vegan diet where I also worked out everyday. Initially it was suppose to be a month but I kept extending it. I can't tell you how much the saying “you are what you eat” resognated with me during my 2nd month. I felt like my body was functioning at 120%. I still mostly eat vegan and work out at least 3 days a week. I love walking, jogging, cycling and going on hikes.",
